	<h4 class="headline">OpenWest Conference 2015</h4>
	<p>
		The OpenWest conference is scheduled for May 6 – 9, 2015 and is a community driven conference
		that focuses on all things Open Source, Open Hardware and Open Standards.
		The community feel of the conference comes in a few ways:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Most of the presentations are from members of the local tech community. While we do fly in national level speakers, the focus is on local community members working with awesome tech.</li>
		<li>Many of the local User Group Leaders are or have been a member of the organizing group – Core Team. This keeps the conference relative to the communities we represent.</li>
		<li>Presentations are selected by the community. Using only the Presentation Title and Description, attendees are able to vote on presentations they’d like to see.</li>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
	<h4 class="headline">Blind community voting</h4>
	<p>
		We use blind community voting as the main factor in deciding which speakers to invite.
		Other factors include the number of talks per topic, travel cost, and the number of talks submitted by that speaker.
		We do NOT take into consideration gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation.
